Your bug ticket must follow this format:
* Title: A concise, descriptive summary of the problem
* Description: A short paragraph explaining the bug in general terms
* Steps to Reproduce: A numbered list of precise steps that lead to the bug
* Expected vs Actual Behavior: What should have happened vs what actually happened
