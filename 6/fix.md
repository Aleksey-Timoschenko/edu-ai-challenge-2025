# Enigma Machine Bug Fixes

## Identified Issues

1. **Rotor Stepping Logic**
   - Bug: The current implementation doesn't implement the double-stepping mechanism correctly
   - Fix: Implement proper double-stepping where the middle rotor steps when either the right rotor is at its notch or the middle rotor is at its notch

2. **Reflector Implementation**
   - Bug: The reflector is implemented as a direct mapping, which is incorrect
   - Fix: Implement proper reflection where each letter maps to another letter and vice versa

3. **Ring Settings**
   - Bug: Ring settings are not properly applied in the rotor transformations
   - Fix: Correctly apply ring settings in both forward and backward transformations

## Implementation Details

The main fixes involve:
1. Rewriting the `stepRotors()` method to implement proper double-stepping
2. Correcting the reflector implementation to ensure proper letter mapping
3. Fixing the ring setting calculations in the Rotor class

These changes ensure that the Enigma machine behaves according to its historical specifications and produces correct encryption/decryption results.
