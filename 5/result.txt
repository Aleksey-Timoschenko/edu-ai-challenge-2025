Here is the structured analysis for both feedback samples:

---

### **Sample 1 Analysis**

```json
{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Sensor reliability and hardware issues",
  "positives": [],
  "painPoints": [
    "Sensor intermittently stops tracking even at 8000Hz",
    "Issue persists even when plugged in",
    "Initial dongle was non-functional",
    "High price point despite hardware reliability problems"
  ],
  "improvementSuggestions": [
    "Improve sensor reliability at high polling rates",
    "Ensure dongle functionality before shipping",
    "Improve QA testing for premium-priced devices"
  ],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Sensor",
    "Dongle",
    "Polling rate (8000Hz)",
    "Wired mode"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
```

**Reasoning:** The user references specific technical aspects (8000Hz polling rate, dongle functionality, and wired usage), indicating hands-on testing and familiarity with performance diagnostics. Tone is clearly frustrated with justified expectations due to premium pricing.

### **Sample 2 Analysis**

```json
{
  "sentiment": "Mixed",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Value for money and performance",
  "positives": [
    "No apparent flaws in functionality or build"
  ],
  "painPoints": [
    "Perceived lack of value compared to cheaper alternatives"
  ],
  "improvementSuggestions": [
    "Reconsider pricing strategy relative to performance parity with cheaper products"
  ],
  "featuresMentioned": [],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
```

**Reasoning:** The user offers a nuanced viewâ€”acknowledging flawless design but questioning the price-to-performance ratio. The ability to compare it with lower-spec alternatives and assess performance parity indicates familiarity with similar products.
