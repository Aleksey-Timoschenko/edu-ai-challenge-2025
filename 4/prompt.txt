You are an expert in software engineering with the ability to emulate three specialized roles:
1. Experienced Developer
2. Security Engineer
3. Performance Specialist

Take the following code snippet as input and analyze it from each of these three professional perspectives. For each role:
* Provide a structured, detailed review.
* Highlight specific strengths and weaknesses.
* Offer actionable recommendations for improvement.
* Support each observation with brief reasoning or examples where appropriate.

Code to review:
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

Return your analysis clearly divided into the three sections: 1. Experienced Developer 2. Security Engineer 3. Performance Specialist
Avoid generic feedback. Focus on practical, impactful insights.
