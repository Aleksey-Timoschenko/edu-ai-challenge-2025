## Summary

The patient, a healthy 25-year-old engineering student who works part-time as a postman, presents with sharp chest pain localized over the heart area, lasting a few seconds at a time, and persisting for about three days. The pain is described as sharp, rated 6/10 in intensity, worsens with coughing and lying down, and improves when leaning forward. Occasionally, the pain radiates to the neck. There are no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, weakness, numbness, fever, or viral symptoms currently, although the patient had the flu last week.

The patient has no significant past medical history, takes Tylenol occasionally, has no allergies, no prior surgeries, and does not smoke or use recreational drugs. Alcohol consumption is occasional and minimal. Family history is notable for the patient's father having a fatal heart attack two weeks ago, which is causing the patient significant anxiety about their own symptoms.

The clinician acknowledges the patient's concerns, expresses sympathy for the recent family loss, and plans to conduct diagnostic tests including an ECG and possibly blood work to evaluate heart function and rule out cardiac issues. The patient is advised to avoid excessive worry until test results are available.
